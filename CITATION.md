We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating a validated open-source beam line model of the iThemba passive beamline, please cite it when using it.

A correct citation is:

... we used the open-source iThemba passive beamline model[1], based on Geant4[2-4], a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter.
